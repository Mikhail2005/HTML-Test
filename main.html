		<h1>The 5 Best Video Games of 2021</h1>

			<h2><strong>1. Minecraft</strong></h2>

				<p> Despite its huge number of copies sold and players registered, it isn’t immediately apparent to many people exactly what the appeal of Minecraft is and how the game has managed to suck in everyone from elementary school kids to retirees. Minecraft belongs to three distinct video game genres and the way those genres intertwine with each other create the experience that draws players in. First, Minecraft is an open world game. In open world games you are free to roam wherever you want with very few limits imposed on you. In most video games, you can only go where the designer of the video game intended you to go (and where they created space for you to go). Take as a simple example, your average Super Mario Bros. game. No matter how much you want to walk outside of Bowser’s Castle and roam around the gardens, you can’t do that because the video game designers never intended for you to go outside the castle and, in the very code of the video game, that garden doesn’t even really exist beyond the little hint of it you see through a window while playing inside the castle level. The pieces of the game beyond the reach of the player are essentially decorative, like backdrops on a stage. In Minecraft there are very few limits like that, because the game was never intended to be played in a linear fashion. With very few exceptions, if you can see something in Minecraft, you can go explore it, touch it, or otherwise interact with it. In addition to an open world design, Minecraft is also a “sandbox” game. Although the term sandbox is often used interchangeably with “open world” to describe games that allow you to roam all over the place with few limitations, a true sandbox game includes tools that allow the player to modify the game world. In that regard, Minecraft is a virtual epitome of sandbox gaming as, regardless of how you play the game, using tools to modify and interact with your environment is the very basis of the experience.</p>

			<h2><strong>2. Call Of Duty - Black Ops 4</strong></h2>
			<div class="info">
				<img src="images/Black-Ops-main-image.jpg" alt: width="600">
				<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 (stylized as Call of Duty: Black Ops IIII) is a first-person shooter video game developed by Treyarch for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and by Beenox (with assistance from Blizzard Entertainment) for Microsoft Windows. The game was released on October 12th, 2018. Featuring no traditional campaign mode for the first time in the franchise, Black Ops 4 puts all its attention into three distinct modes: Multiplayer, Zombies, and the all-new battle royale mode Blackout. However, the game will include single-player Solo Missions that focus on the lore and stories of the game's multiplayer characters, or "Specialists." Multiplayer is traditional, yet redefined, featuring gritty, grounded, fluid multiplayer combat. Zombies contains brand new experiences along with more customization on how the player wishes to play, with the deep gameplay and easter eggs that its fans have come to expect. Blackout is a brand new addition to the Call of Duty franchise. It is Treyarch's take on the battle royale genre of games, where the universe of Black Ops comes to life in one massive battle royale experience featuring the largest map in Call of Duty history, signature Black Ops combat, characters, locations and weapons from the entire Black Ops series.An official announcement trailer for the game was released on March 8, 2018, in addition, a community reveal event was held on May 17, 2018. Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 is the 15th game in the Call of Duty franchise and Treyarch's second to be developed in a three-year development cycle.</p>

			<h2><strong>3. Rocket League </strong></h2>
			<div class="info">
				<img src="images/Rocket-League-main-image.jpg" alt: width="600">
				<p>Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars," Rocket League involves two teams that use rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match. The objective is for players to work with their team to advance the ball down the field, and score goals in their opponents’ net. Furthermore, Rocket League is a technical game which involves both high-level dexterity and fast-paced gameplay. While one of the most welcoming elements of the game is its accessibility and familiarity with traditional sport (soccer), the best players are highly advanced and have fine-tuned their mechanics.  How it’s played is as follows. Each team starts on opposite sides of the field, as either the Blue or Orange team. When the timer begins, players race to be the first to hit the ball with their car. Once the ball is in play, the clock winds down until a team scores by hitting the ball into the opposing team’s goal, at which point players return to their starting positions and repeat that process until time runs out. The team with the most goals at the end of regulation wins. If there is a tie, the teams play periods of overtime until a winner is determined. What makes Rocket League different from Soccer are its competitors: rocket powered cars. Players choose their vehicle before each game, and have various customization options. During the game, cars earn “boost” by driving over lit circles on the field, and can “fly” by combining boosting with jumping.</p>

			<div class="info">

In the game, the player takes control of Eivor, a Viking from Norway who participated in the Norse invasion of England during the 9th century. Driven from Norway by endless wars and dwindling resources in the ninth century CE, players will lead Eivor's clan of Norsemen across the icy North Sea to the rich lands of England's broken kingdoms. Players must carve out a new future for their clan, reliving the ruthless fighting style of Viking warriors with a revamped combat system that includes the ability to dual-wield weapons against a greater variety of enemies than ever before. To secure resources players can lead raids to select locations using their longship to earn much-needed riches and resources. As the Vikings begin to settle in their new home, they encounter resistance from the Saxons including King Aelfred of Wessex, who denounces them as heathens and looks to be the sole ruler of a civilized England. Against all odds, Eivor must do what is necessary to keep Valhalla within reach.</p>
